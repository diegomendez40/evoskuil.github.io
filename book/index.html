            <div class="title">Introduction</div>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="paragraph">Do you think you know something about Bitcoin and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School">Austrian Economics</a>? If so you may be ready for <span class="italic">Cryptoeconomics</span>. This is not a work for the uninitiated. It is not a narrative and is free of opinion. The content is dense – it does not repeat itself. It is not a contribution to the echo chamber, will not show you how to set up a wallet, the future price, or what to do.</div>
				<div class="paragraph"><span class="italic">Cryptoeconomics</span> applies rational economic principles to Bitcoin, demonstrating flaws and unnecessary complexities in them, and in common understandings of Bitcoin. It will improve your understanding of both. Bitcoin requires a new, rigorous, and comprehensive discipline. <span class="bold">This is it.</span></div>
                <div class="paragraph">Bitcoin is something new. It seems to defy understanding. Has there ever been a fixed supply money? Is there another case of production cost varying directly with product price? Is there anything else with a competitive yet fixed rate of transactability? To see past the hype, understand the value proposition, security model, and economic behavior, this may be your only source.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">Bitcoin is economics, technology, and security. Without incorporating all of these aspects, errors will be made. Economists, technologists, security experts, and even <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionusd">numerologists</a> have attempted to explain it. Each brings a limited perspective, failing to incorporate essential aspects. The author found himself uniquely qualified to integrate them.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">His work in Bitcoin began with a hardware wallet. He spent a year analyzing threats, working with electronics design, hardware exploitation, and state surveillance experts. He chose the <a href="https://libbitcoin.info">Libbitcoin</a> software library, as Satoshi’s prototype was not factored for development and was largely financed by the <a href="https://bitcoinfoundation.org">Bitcoin Foundation</a>, a corporate consortium. He later dedicated himself to Libbitcoin, eventually writing or editing all of its ~500,000 lines of code. Few have comparable experience with such a comprehensive Bitcoin stack.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">As a combat-experienced fighter pilot in the <a href="https://www.navy.mil">U.S. Navy</a> he experienced state threats. He became a highly-qualified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_Strike_Fighter_Tactics_Instructor_program">Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor</a>, in which his primary role was tactics analysis and threat presentation. He also advised for the Navy on the <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/navy/ntsp/SFTS.htm">Strike Fighter Training System</a> network, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Strike_Fighter_program">Joint Strike Fighter</a>, early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_bomb#Satellite">GPS weapons</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet">F/A-18</a> systems. His understanding of the physical nature of all security was enhanced by decades of training in Japanese martial arts, achieving black belt rankings in five disciplines.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">His <a href="https://www.rpi.edu">degree</a> and experience in computer science mixed with extensive business experience, founding several companies. He has worked at <a href="https://ibm.com">IBM</a> and as a Principal Architect at <a href="https://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, two of the world’s largest companies. The latter purchased his first startup, and his second was acquired by <a href="https://www.veritascapital.com">Veritas Capital</a>. He was awarded three related <a href=https://www.uspto.gov">U.S. patents</a>. Eventually he became an angel investor, sharing his experience with other entrepreneurs.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer">CTO</a> of his first company he published three computer security advisories via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERT_Coordination_Center">Computer Emergency Response Team</a>. Each was derived entirely from his reading of user documentation. Later he earned a seat on the <a href="https://dhs.gov">DHS</a> <a href="https://oval.cisecurity.org">Open Vulnerability Assessment Language</a> advisory board for his work on software patching. In recent years he uncovered material security flaws in each of the first three iterations of a popular “secure element” hardware wallet, again from review of user documentation.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">Thirty years of self-study in free market economics was reinforced by extensive global travel. In visiting over 80 countries he has interacted with people on five continents. Still often traveling on a motorcycle with only a shoulder bag, he obtains intimate understanding of global economic realities. From Zimbabwean black market currency traders, to Tanzanian coffee pickers, Venezuelan refugees, Mongolian shepherds, Okinawan jazz musicians, Lao monks, etc. – the world is not as often presented.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">The ability to integrate these diverse and relevant experiences led to <span class="italic">Cryptoeconomics</span>. This is your next stop.</div>
